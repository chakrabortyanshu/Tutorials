/**
 * Contrary to the assertTimeoutPreemptively() assertion, the execution of the
 * annotated method proceeds in the main thread of the test. If the timeout is
 * exceeded, the main thread is interrupted from another thread. This is done to
 * ensure interoperability with frameworks such as Spring that make use of
 * mechanisms that are sensitive to the currently running thread â€” for example,
 * ThreadLocal transaction management.
 * 
 * To apply the same timeout to all test methods within a test class and all of
 * its @Nested classes, you can declare the @Timeout annotation at the class
 * level. It will then be applied to all test, test factory, and test template
 * methods within that class and its @Nested classes unless overridden by
 * a @Timeout annotation on a specific method or @Nested class. Please note
 * that @Timeout annotations declared at the class level are not applied to
 * lifecycle methods.
 * 
 * 
 * If you need more control over polling intervals and greater flexibility with
 * asynchronous tests, consider using a dedicated library such as Awaitility.
